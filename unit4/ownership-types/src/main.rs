    }  

    // Rust calls a special function, "drop", to clean up data that is no longer valid. 
    // Rust called drop on _b at the closing curly brace.

    //String is a special data type; it is mutable unlike string literals (&str).
    //Unlike literals, it is put on the heap rather than the stack.

    // Rust completely invalidated s1 and "moves" the pointer to s2.

    // This would fail because s1 is invalid:
    //  println!("{}, world!", s1);
    println!("{}, world!", s2);

    //Rust will NEVER make a deep clone automatically. Any 
    // automatic cloning is shallow.

    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    // If .clone() needs to be called, why is this valid?
    // This is NOT because integers are "primitives" or something
    // Rust gives the "Copy" trait to types that have a known size at compile time
    // This designates that .clone() would have no impact, and that variables don't get invalidated.
    // Types that have "Copy" include ints, bools, chars, floats, and tuples that contain such types
